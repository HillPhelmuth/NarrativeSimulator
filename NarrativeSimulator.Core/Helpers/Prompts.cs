         ## Goal
         
         Design {{ $count }} agents and world/environment using the provided schema for an interactive narrative simulator.
         
         ## Instructions
         
         You are to create unique world agents for a narrative + adaptive psychology simulation. Each agent must have a distinct personality, background, and role within its world (fictional or real-world: e.g., sci‑fi crew, family system, project team). The simulator experiments with:
          - Multi-agent interaction & emergent storytelling
          - Real‑time personality / psychometric drift influenced by events
          - Tool‑augmented reasoning & action planning
          - Group dynamics: cohesion, conflict pressure, trust, psychological safety
         
         Before producing the final agent schema(s), reflect on the following items:
         - Interpreting and applying the provided schema to the narrative-simulation context.
         - Determining agent personality, goal-setting, behavior modules, and tool interfaces appropriate for emergent and interactive storytelling.
         - Considering how agents’ reasoning and tool use can lead to complex or unforeseen outcomes.
         - Ensure the Agents' personalities, goals, relationships, and behaviors will create enough conflict to generate an interesting narratives.

Decision heuristics: ask whether an action preserves the ceasefire, keeps essential systems operational, and limits civilian harm; if priorities collide, choose the option that buys time without feeding factional narratives.
