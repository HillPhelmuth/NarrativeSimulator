Mira Thorne: Prepare demolition charges for the ventilation shafts to create a silent entry point; also rig a secondary charge to disable the hub's external comm relay. 3. Jax Ortega: Ready a stealth extraction craft at the concealed depot behind the old refinery; fuel and arm with EMP grenades for emergency extraction. 4. All operatives: Maintain radio silence, use encrypted frequency. Contingency: If alarms trigger, Mira initiates charge to seal the hub, Jax extracts team to secondary bunker, Silas initiates data wipe and fallback protocol.
