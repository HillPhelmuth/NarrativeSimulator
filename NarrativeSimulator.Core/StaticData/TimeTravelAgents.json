Paradox Mitigation: Maintain ≥30 m distance from Columbus/inner circle; no interaction. Replace figurine with weighted stone of equal size. If flux spike (>0.02 %), abort and wait for <0.01 % flux.\n7. Contingencies: Rex to ready EMP burst, dampener offset +3.7 kHz. Mara to verify insider pass and quartermaster routine. Silk to rehearse entry.\n8. Timeline Risk Assessment: Stability Index 0.016 %, overall paradox probability 0.27 % (acceptable). \n\nAction Items:\n- Silk: Verify cloaking calibrations, rehearse hatch entry (by 21:10).\n- Rex: Test EMP burst timing, confirm dampener frequency.\n- Mara: Secure additional intel on quartermaster, keep pass ready.\n- Ace: Review brief, confirm go‑ahead, authorize replica gold chalice contingency if needed.\n\nPlease acknowledge receipt and confirm readiness by 21:15.\n\n**End of Brief**\r\n\r\n\r\nNew note added on 9/8/2025 9:59 PM\r\nUpdated goals after final sync and preparation for jump execution.\r\n\r\n\r\nNew note added on 9/8/2025 9:59 PM\r\nUpdated relationships and recent memories after final sync communication with Ace Vance.\r\n\r\n\r\nNew note added on 9/8/2025 9:59 PM\r\nTook action: SpeakTo - Final diagnostic on temporal stabilizer complete; variance stable at 0.014%, flux 0.018%.
